# Quiz Application

## Introduction
In this project I have developed a quiz application which is completely built using html, css and javascript. Several categories are available, and questions will only be displayed according to the categories you have selected. There are a total of 15 questions and after every 5 questions the difficulty level will be increased and the time will also be increased by 15 seconds. After completing the quiz, the result will be displayed.
